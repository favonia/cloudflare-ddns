## 📜 Highlights

### ⚡ Efficiency

* 🤏 The Docker images are ultra-small (about 2.5 MB).
* 🔁 The Go runtime will re-use existing HTTP connections.
* 🗃️ It caches Cloudflare API responses to reduce the API usage.

### 💯 Comprehensive Support of Domain Names

Simply list all the domain names and you are done!

* 🌍 Internationalized domain names (_e.g._, `🐱.example.org`) are fully supported. _(The updater smooths out [some rough edges of the Cloudflare API](https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflare-go/pull/690#issuecomment-911884832).)_
* 🃏 Wildcard domain names (_e.g._, `*.example.org`) are also supported.
* 🔍 This updater automatically finds the DNS zones for you, and it can handle multiple DNS zones.
* 🕹️ You can toggle IPv4 (`A` records), IPv6 (`AAAA` records) and Cloudflare proxying for each domain. _(The per-domain proxy setting is experimental and [wants your feedback](https://github.com/favonia/cloudflare-ddns/issues/199).)_

### 🕵️ Privacy

By default, public IP addresses are obtained using the [Cloudflare debugging page](https://1.1.1.1/cdn-cgi/trace). This minimizes the impact on privacy because we are already using the Cloudflare API to update DNS records. Moreover, if Cloudflare servers are not reachable, chances are you could not update DNS records anyways. You can also configure the updater to use [ipify](https://www.ipify.org), which claims not to log any visitor information. [Open a GitHub issue](https://github.com/favonia/cloudflare-ddns/issues/new) to propose a new method to detect public IP addresses.

### 🛡️ Security

* 🛑 The superuser privileges are immediately dropped after the updater starts.
* 🖥️ Optionally, you can [monitor the updater via Healthchecks.io](https://healthchecks.io), which will notify you when the updating fails.
* 📚 The updater uses only established open-source Go libraries.

## ⛷️ Quick Start

<details><summary>🐋 Directly run the provided Docker images.</summary>

```bash
docker run \
  --network host \
  -e CF_API_TOKEN=YOUR-CLOUDFLARE-API-TOKEN \
  -e DOMAINS=example.org,www.example.org,example.io \
  -e PROXIED=true \
  favonia/cloudflare-ddns
```
</details>

<details><summary>🧬 Directly run the updater from its source on Linux.</summary>

You need the [Go tool](https://golang.org/doc/install) to run the updater from its source.

```bash
CF_API_TOKEN=YOUR-CLOUDFLARE-API-TOKEN \
  DOMAINS=example.org,www.example.org,example.io \
  PROXIED=true \
  go run ./cmd/*.go
```

👉 For non-Linux operating systems, please use Docker images instead.
</details>

## 🐋 Deployment with Docker Compose

### 📦 Step 1: Updating the Compose File

Incorporate the following fragment into the compose file (typically `docker-compose.yml` or `docker-compose.yaml`).

```yaml
version: "3"
services:
  cloudflare-ddns:
    image: favonia/cloudflare-ddns:latest
    network_mode: host
    restart: always
    security_opt:
      - no-new-privileges:true
    environment:
      - PGID=1000
      - PUID=1000
      - CF_API_TOKEN=YOUR-CLOUDFLARE-API-TOKEN
      - DOMAINS=example.org,www.example.org,example.io
      - PROXIED=true
```

<details>
<summary>📡 Use <code>network_mode: host</code> to enable IPv6 (or read more).</summary>

The easiest way to enable IPv6 is to use `network_mode: host` so that the updater can access the host IPv6 network directly. If you wish to keep the updater isolated from the host network, check out the [official documentation on IPv6](https://docs.docker.com/config/daemon/ipv6/) and [this GitHub issue about IPv6](https://github.com/favonia/cloudflare-ddns/issues/119). If your host OS is Linux, here’s the tl;dr:

1. Use `network_mode: bridge` instead of `network_mode: host`.
2. Edit or create `/etc/docker/daemon.json` with the following content:
   ```json
   {
     "ipv6": true,
     "fixed-cidr-v6": "fd00::/8",
     "experimental": true,
     "ip6tables": true
   }
   ```
3. Restart the Docker daemon (if you are using systemd):
   ```sh
   systemctl restart docker.service
   ```
</details>

<details>
<summary>🔁 Use <code>restart: always</code> to automatically restart the updater on system reboot.</summary>

Docker’s default restart policies should prevent excessive logging when there are configuration errors.
</details>

<details>
<summary>🛡️ Use <code>no-new-privileges:true</code>, <code>PUID</code>, and <code>PGID</code> to protect yourself.</summary>

Change `1000` to the user or group IDs you wish to use to run the updater. The setting `no-new-privileges:true` provides additional protection, especially when you run the container as a non-superuser. The updater itself will read <code>PUID</code> and <code>PGID</code> and attempt to drop all those privileges as much as possible.
</details>

<details>
<summary>🎭 Use <code>PROXIED=true</code> to hide your IP addresses.</summary>

The setting `PROXIED=true` instructs Cloudflare to cache webpages on your machine and hide your actual IP addresses. If you wish to bypass that and expose your actual IP addresses, simply remove `PROXIED=true`. (The default value of `PROXIED` is `false`.)
</details>

### 🪧 Step 2: Updating the Environment File

Add these lines to your environment file (typically `.env`):
```bash
CF_API_TOKEN=YOUR-CLOUDFLARE-API-TOKEN
DOMAINS=example.org,www.example.org,example.io
```

<details>
<summary>🔑 <code>CF_API_TOKEN</code> is your Cloudflare API token.</summary>

The value of `CF_API_TOKEN` should be an API **token** (_not_ an API key), which can be obtained from the [API Tokens page](https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens). Use the **Edit zone DNS** template to create and copy a token into the environment file. ⚠️ The less secure API key authentication is deliberately _not_ supported.
</details>

<details>
<summary>📍 <code>DOMAINS</code> contains the domains to update.</summary>

The value of `DOMAINS` should be a list of fully qualified domain names separated by commas. For example, `DOMAINS=example.org,www.example.org,example.io` instructs the updater to manage the domains `example.org`, `www.example.org`, and `example.io`. These domains do not have to be in the same zone---the updater will identify their zones automatically.
</details>

### 🚀 Step 3: Building the Container

```bash
docker-compose pull cloudflare-ddns
docker-compose up --detach --build cloudflare-ddns
```

## ☸️ Deployment with Kubernetes

Kubernetes offers great flexibility in assembling different objects together. The following shows a minimum setup.

### 📝 Step 1: Creating a YAML File

Save the following configuration as `cloudflare-ddns.yaml`.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: cloudflare-ddns
  labels:
    app: cloudflare-ddns
spec:
  replicas: 1
  strategy:
    type: Recreate
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: cloudflare-ddns
  template:
    metadata:
      name: cloudflare-ddns
      labels:
        app: cloudflare-ddns
    spec:
      restartPolicy: Always
      containers:
        - name: cloudflare-ddns
          image: favonia/cloudflare-ddns:latest
          securityContext:
            allowPrivilegeEscalation: false
            runAsUser: 1000
            runAsGroup: 1000
          env:
            - name: "IP6_PROVIDER"
              value: "none"
            - name: "PROXIED"
              value: "true"
            - name: "CF_API_TOKEN"
              value: "YOUR-CLOUDFLARE-API-TOKEN"
            - name: "DOMAINS"
              value: "example.org,www.example.org,example.io"
```

<details>
<summary>🔁 Use <code>restartPolicy: Always</code> to automatically restart the updater on system reboot.</summary>

Kubernetes’s default restart policies should prevent excessive logging when there are configuration errors.
</details>

<details>
<summary>🛡️ Use <code>runAsUser</code>, <code>runAsGroup</code>, and <code>allowPrivilegeEscalation: false</code> to protect yourself.</summary>

Kubernetes comes with built-in support to drop superuser privileges. The updater itself will also attempt to drop all of them.
</details>

<details>
<summary>📡 Use <code>IP6_PROVIDER: "none"</code> to disable IPv6 management.</summary>

The support of IPv6 in Kubernetes has been improving, but a working setup still takes effort. Since Kubernetes 1.21+, the [IPv4/IPv6 dual stack](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/dual-stack/) is enabled by default, but a setup which allows IPv6 egress traffic (_e.g.,_ to reach Cloudflare servers to detect public IPv6 addresses) still requires deep understanding of Kubernetes and is beyond this simple guide. The popular tool [minicube](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/), which implements a simple local Kubernetes cluster, unfortunately [does not support IPv6 yet](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/faq/#does-minikube-support-ipv6). Until there is an easy way to enable IPv6 in Kubernetes, the template here will have IPv6 disabled.

If you manage to enable IPv6, congratulations. Feel free to remove `IP6_PROVIDER: "none"` to detect and update both `A` and `AAAA` records. There is almost no danger in enabling IPv6 even when the IPv6 setup is not working. In the worst case, the updater will remove all `AAAA` records associated with the domains in `DOMAINS` and `IP6_DOMAINS` because those records will appear to be “stale.” The deleted records will be recreated once the updater correctly detects the IPv6 addresses.
</details>

<details>
<summary>🎭 Use <code>PROXIED: "true"</code> to hide your IP addresses.</summary>

The setting `PROXIED: "true"` instructs Cloudflare to cache webpages on your machine and hide your actual IP addresses. If you wish to bypass that and expose your actual IP addresses, simply remove `PROXIED: "true"`. (The default value of `PROXIED` is `false`.)
</details>

<details>
<summary>🔑 <code>CF_API_TOKEN</code> is your Cloudflare API token.</summary>

The value of `CF_API_TOKEN` should be an API **token** (_not_ an API key), which can be obtained from the [API Tokens page](https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens). Use the **Edit zone DNS** template to create and copy a token into the environment file. ⚠️ The less secure API key authentication is deliberately _not_ supported.
</details>

<details>
<summary>📍 <code>DOMAINS</code> contains the domains to update.</summary>

The value of `DOMAINS` should be a list of fully qualified domain names separated by commas. For example, `DOMAINS=example.org,www.example.org,example.io` instructs the updater to manage the domains `example.org`, `www.example.org`, and `example.io`. These domains do not have to be in the same zone---the updater will identify their zones automatically.
</details>

### 🚀 Step 2: Creating the Deployment

```sh
kubectl create -f cloudflare-ddns.yaml
```

## 🎛️ Further Customization

### ⚙️ All Settings

<details>
<summary>🔑 Cloudflare accounts and API tokens</summary>

| Name | Valid Values | Meaning | Required? | Default Value |
| ---- | ------------ | ------- | --------- | ------------- |
| `CF_ACCOUNT_ID` | Cloudflare Account IDs | The account ID used to distinguish multiple zone IDs with the same name | No | `""` (unset) |
| `CF_API_TOKEN_FILE` | Paths to files containing Cloudflare API tokens | A file that contains the token to access the Cloudflare API | Exactly one of `CF_API_TOKEN` and `CF_API_TOKEN_FILE` should be set | N/A |
| `CF_API_TOKEN` | Cloudflare API tokens | The token to access the Cloudflare API | Exactly one of `CF_API_TOKEN` and `CF_API_TOKEN_FILE` should be set | N/A |

In most cases, `CF_ACCOUNT_ID` is not needed.
</details>

<details>
<summary>📍 Domains and IP providers</summary>

| Name | Valid Values | Meaning | Required? | Default Value |
| ---- | ------------ | ------- | --------- | ------------- |
| `DOMAINS` | Comma-separated fully qualified domain names or wildcard domain names | The domains the updater should manage for both `A` and `AAAA` records | (See below) | N/A
| `IP4_DOMAINS` | Comma-separated fully qualified domain names or wildcard domain names | The domains the updater should manage for `A` records | (See below) | N/A
| `IP6_DOMAINS` | Comma-separated fully qualified domain names or wildcard domain names | The domains the updater should manage for `AAAA` records | (See below) | N/A
| `IP4_PROVIDER` | `cloudflare.doh`, `cloudflare.trace`, `ipify`, `local`, and `none` | How to detect IPv4 addresses. (See below) | No | `cloudflare.trace`
| `IP6_PROVIDER` | `cloudflare.doh`, `cloudflare.trace`, `ipify`, `local`, and `none` | How to detect IPv6 addresses. (See below) | No | `cloudflare.trace`

> <details>
> <summary>📍 At least one of <code>DOMAINS</code> and <code>IP4/6_DOMAINS</code> must be non-empty.</summary>
>
> At least one domain should be listed in `DOMAINS`, `IP4_DOMAINS`, or `IP6_DOMAINS`. Otherwise, if all of them are empty, then the updater has nothing to do. It is fine to list the same domain in both `IP4_DOMAINS` and `IP6_DOMAINS`, which is equivalent to listing it in `DOMAINS`. Internationalized domain names are supported using the non-transitional processing that is fully compatible with IDNA2008.

>
> - `cloudflare.doh`\
>  Get the public IP address by querying `whoami.cloudflare.` against [Cloudflare via DNS-over-HTTPS](https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/dns-over-https) and update DNS records accordingly.
> - `cloudflare.trace`\
>  Get the public IP address by parsing the [Cloudflare debugging page](https://1.1.1.1/cdn-cgi/trace) and update DNS records accordingly.

>   Get the address via local network interfaces and update DNS records accordingly. When multiple local network interfaces or in general multiple IP addresses are present, the updater will use the address that would have been used for outbound UDP connections to Cloudflare servers. ⚠️ You need access to the host network (such as `network_mode: host` in Docker Compose or `hostNetwork: true` in Kubernetes) for this policy, for otherwise the updater will detect the addresses inside the [bridge network in Docker](https://docs.docker.com/network/bridge/) or the [default namespaces in Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/namespaces/) instead of those in the host network.
> - `none`\
>   Stop the DNS updating completely. Existing DNS records will not be removed.

### 🔂 Restarting the Container

If you are using Docker Compose, run `docker-compose up --detach` after changing the settings.

If you are using Kubernetes, run `kubectl replace -f cloudflare-ddns.yaml` after changing the settings.

## 🚵 Migration Guides

<details>
<summary>I am migrating from <a href="https://hub.docker.com/r/oznu/cloudflare-ddns/">oznu/cloudflare-ddns.</a></summary>

⚠️ [oznu/cloudflare-ddns](https://hub.docker.com/r/oznu/cloudflare-ddns/) relies on unverified DNS responses to obtain public IP addresses; a malicious hacker could potentially manipulate or forge DNS responses and trick it into updating your domain with any IP address. In comparison, we use only verified responses from Cloudflare or ipify.

| Old Parameter |  | New Paramater |
| ------------- | - | ------------- |
| `API_KEY=key` | ✔️ | Use `CF_API_TOKEN=key` |
| `API_KEY_FILE=file` | ✔️ | Use `CF_API_TOKEN_FILE=file` |
| `ZONE=example.org` and `SUBDOMAIN=sub` | ✔️ | Use `DOMAINS=sub.example.org` directly |
| `PROXIED=true` | ✔️ | Same |
| `RRTYPE=A` | ✔️ | Both IPv4 and IPv6 are enabled by default; use `IP6_PROVIDER=none` to disable IPv6 |
| `RRTYPE=AAAA` | ✔️ | Both IPv4 and IPv6 are enabled by default; use `IP4_PROVIDER=none` to disable IPv4 |
| `DELETE_ON_STOP=true` | ✔️ | Same |
