A feature-rich and robust Cloudflare DDNS updater with a small footprint. The program will detect your machine’s public IP addresses and update DNS records using the Cloudflare API.

## 📜 Highlights

### ⚡ Efficiency

- 🤏 The Docker image takes less than 5 MB after compression.
- 🔁 The Go runtime re-uses existing HTTP connections.
- 🗃️ Cloudflare API responses are cached to reduce the API usage.

### 💯 Complete Support of Domain Names

- 😌 You can simply list domains (_e.g._, `www.a.org, hello.io`) without knowing their DNS zones.
- 🌍 [Internationalized domain names](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internationalized_domain_name) (_e.g._, `🐱.example.org` and `日本｡co｡jp`) are fully supported.
- 🃏 [Wildcard domains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildcard_DNS_record) (_e.g._, `*.example.org`) are also supported.
- 🕹️ You can toggle IPv4 (`A` records) and IPv6 (`AAAA` records) for each domain.

### 🌥️ Cloudflare-specific Features

- 😶‍🌫️ You can toggle [Cloudflare proxying](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/manage-dns-records/reference/proxied-dns-records/) for each domain.
- 📝 You can set [comments](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/manage-dns-records/reference/record-attributes/) for new DNS records.
- 📜 The updater can maintain [lists](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/tools/lists/custom-lists/) of detected IP addresses. These lists can then be referenced in any Cloudflare product that uses [Cloudflare’s Rules language](https://developers.cloudflare.com/ruleset-engine/), such as [Cloudflare Web Application Firewall (WAF)](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/) and [Cloudflare Rules](https://developers.cloudflare.com/rules/). (We call the lists “WAF lists”, but their use is not limited to Cloudflare WAF.)

### 👁️ Integration with Notification Services

- 🩺 The updater can report to [Healthchecks](https://healthchecks.io) or [Uptime Kuma](https://uptime.kuma.pet) so that you receive notifications when it fails to update IP addresses.
- 📣 The updater can also actively update you via any service supported by the [shoutrrr library](https://containrrr.dev/shoutrrr/), including emails, major notification services, major messaging platforms, and generic webhooks.

### 🕵️ Minimum Privacy Impact

By default, public IP addresses are obtained via [Cloudflare’s debugging page](https://one.one.one.one/cdn-cgi/trace). This minimizes the impact on privacy because we are already using the Cloudflare API to update DNS records. Moreover, if Cloudflare servers are not reachable, chances are you cannot update DNS records anyways.

### 🛡️ Attention to Security

- 🛡️ The updater uses only HTTPS or [DNS over HTTPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNS_over_HTTPS) to detect IP addresses. This makes it harder for someone else to trick the updater into updating your DNS records with wrong IP addresses. See the [Security Model](docs/DESIGN.markdown#network-security-threat-model) for more information.

## 🏁 Deployment as a System Service

See [community-contributed sample configurations](./contrib/README.markdown) for OpenBSD.

## 🐋 Deployment with Docker Compose

### 📦 Step 1: Updating the Compose File

Incorporate the following fragment into the compose file (typically `docker-compose.yml` or `docker-compose.yaml`). The template may look a bit scary, but only because it includes various optional flags for extra security protection.

```yaml
services:
  cloudflare-ddns:
    image: favonia/cloudflare-ddns:latest
    # Choose the appropriate tag based on your need:
    # - "latest" for the latest stable version (which could become 2.x.y
    #   in the future and break things)
    # - "1" for the latest stable version whose major version is 1
    # - "1.x.y" to pin the specific version 1.x.y
    network_mode: host
    # This bypasses network isolation and makes IPv6 easier (optional; see below)
    restart: always
    # Restart the updater after reboot
    user: "1000:1000"
    # Run the updater with specific user and group IDs (in that order).
    # You can change the two numbers based on your need.
    read_only: true
    # Make the container filesystem read-only (optional but recommended)
    cap_drop: [all]
    # Drop all Linux capabilities (optional but recommended)
    security_opt: [no-new-privileges:true]
    # Another protection to restrict superuser privileges (optional but recommended)
    environment:
      - CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN=YOUR-CLOUDFLARE-API-TOKEN
        # Your Cloudflare API token
      - DOMAINS=example.org,www.example.org,example.io
        # Your domains (separated by commas)
      - PROXIED=true
        # Tell Cloudflare to cache webpages and hide your IP (optional)
#networks:
#  LAN0:
#    external: true
#    name: LAN0
# Introduce custom Docker networks to the 'services' in this file. A common use case
# for this is binding one of the 'services' to a specific network interface available at
# Docker's host. This section is required for the 'networks' section of each 'services'.
```

<details>
<summary><em>Click to expand:</em> 🔑 <code>CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN</code> is your Cloudflare API token</summary>

The value of `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` should be an API **token** (_not_ an API key), which can be obtained from the [API Tokens page](https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens). Use the **Edit zone DNS** template to create a token. The less secure API key authentication is deliberately _not_ supported.

There is an optional feature (available since version 1.14.0) that lets you maintain a [WAF list](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/tools/lists/custom-lists/) of detected IP addresses. To use this feature, edit the token and grant it the **Account - Account Filter Lists - Edit** permission. If you only need to update WAF lists, not DNS records, you can remove the **Zone - DNS - Edit** permission. Refer to the detailed documentation below for information on updating WAF lists.

</details>

<details>
<summary><em>Click to expand:</em> 📍 <code>DOMAINS</code> is the list of domains to update</summary>

The value of `DOMAINS` should be a list of [fully qualified domain names (FQDNs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fully_qualified_domain_name) separated by commas. For example, `DOMAINS=example.org,www.example.org,example.io` instructs the updater to manage the domains `example.org`, `www.example.org`, and `example.io`. These domains do not have to share the same DNS zone---the updater will take care of the DNS zones behind the scene.

</details>

<details>
<summary><em>Click to expand:</em> 🚨 Remove <code>PROXIED=true</code> if you are <em>not</em> running a web server</summary>

The setting `PROXIED=true` instructs Cloudflare to cache webpages and hide your IP addresses. If you wish to bypass that and expose your actual IP addresses, remove `PROXIED=true`. If your traffic is not HTTP(S), then Cloudflare cannot proxy it and you should probably turn off the proxying by removing `PROXIED=true`. The default value of `PROXIED` is `false`.

</details>

<details>
<summary><em>Click to expand:</em> 📴 Add <code>IP6_PROVIDER=none</code> if you want to disable IPv6 completely</summary>

The updater, by default, will attempt to update DNS records for both IPv4 and IPv6, and there is no harm in leaving the automatic detection on even if your network does not work for one of them. However, if you want to disable IPv6 entirely (perhaps to avoid seeing the detection errors), add `IP6_PROVIDER=none`.

</details>

<details>
<summary><em>Click to expand:</em> 📡 Use IPv6 without bypassing network isolation (without <code>network_mode: host</code>)</summary>

The easiest way to enable IPv6 is to use `network_mode: host` so that the updater can access the host IPv6 network directly. This has the downside of bypassing the network isolation. If you wish to keep the updater isolated from the host network, remove `network_mode: host` and follow the steps in the [official Docker documentation to enable IPv6](https://docs.docker.com/config/daemon/ipv6/). Do use newer versions of Docker that come with much better IPv6 support!

</details>

<details>
<summary><em>Click to expand:</em> 🛜 Bind to a specific network interface for updates</summary>

📜 This method uses a MacVLAN sub-device to bind to a specific network interface and may bypass your custom `iptables` and `nftables` configurations.

To be able to use a specific network interface when detecting the IP in the DDNS updates, the following Docker network must be created before running a Docker container with a custom network:

```bash
docker network create
    -d macvlan
    -o parent=eth0 # host network interface name to bind to
    --subnet=192.168.1.0/24 # IP space for running containers within this network
    --gateway=192.168.1.1 # IP address of the gateway/router
    --ip-range=192.168.1.128/25 # communication IP range for containers in this network
    LAN0 # name that will be used in the docker-compose.yml
```

Once the new Docker network is created, add the following to the Docker Compose that will start the `cloudflare-ddns` service. This enforces all requests from this service to go through the mentioned network, e.g. 'LAN0'.

```yaml
networks:
  LAN0:
  #  ipv4_address: 192.168.1.131 # A static IP within subnet (line can be removed for a random IP)
```

If a static IP is preferred, an `ipv4_address` section like the example can be added. NOTE: this IP must be within the `--subnet` of the Docker network.

<details>
<summary><em>Click to expand:</em> 🛡️ Change <code>user: "1000:1000"</code> to the user and group IDs you want to use</summary>

Change `1000:1000` to `USER:GROUP` for the `USER` and `GROUP` IDs you wish to use to run the updater. The settings `cap_drop`, `read_only`, and `no-new-privileges` in the template provide additional protection, especially when you run the container as a non-superuser.

</details>

### 🚀 Step 2: Building and Running the Container

```bash
docker-compose pull cloudflare-ddns
docker-compose up --detach --build cloudflare-ddns
```

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions

<details>
<summary><em>Click to expand:</em> ❔ I simulated an IP address change by editing the DNS records, but the updater never picked it up!</summary>

Please rest assured that the updater is working as expected. **It will update the DNS records _immediately_ for a real IP change.** Here is a detailed explanation. There are two causes of an IP mismatch:

1. A change of your actual IP address (a _real_ change), or
2. A change of the IP address in the DNS records (a _simulated_ change).

The updater assumes no one will actively change the DNS records. In other words, it assumes simulated changes will not happen. It thus caches the DNS records and cannot detect your simulated changes. However, when your actual IP address changes, the updater will immediately update the DNS records. Also, the updater will eventually check the DNS records and detect simulated changes after `CACHE_EXPIRATION` (six hours by default) has passed.

If you really wish to test the updater with simulated IP changes in the DNS records, you can set `CACHE_EXPIRATION=1ns` (all cache expiring in one nanosecond), effectively disabling the caching. However, it is recommended to keep the default value (six hours) to reduce your network traffic.

</details>

<details>
<summary><em>Click to expand:</em> ❔ How can I see the timestamps of the IP checks and/or updates?</summary>

The updater does not itself add timestamps because all major systems already timestamp everything:

- If you are using Docker Compose, Kubernetes, or Docker directly, add the option `--timestamps` when viewing the logs.
- If you are using Portainer, [enable “Show timestamp” when viewing the logs](https://docs.portainer.io/user/docker/containers/logs).

</details>

<details>
<summary><em>Click to expand:</em> ❔ Why did the updater detect a public IP address different from the WAN IP address on my router?</summary>

Is your “public” IP address on your router between `100.64.0.0` and `100.127.255.255`? If so, you are within your ISP’s [CGNAT (Carrier-grade NAT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carrier-grade_NAT). In practice, there is no way for DDNS to work with CGNAT, because your ISP does not give you a real public IP address, nor does it allow you to forward IP packages to your router using cool protocols such as [Port Control Protocol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Port_Control_Protocol). You have to give up DDNS or switch to another ISP. You may consider other services such as [Cloudflare Tunnel](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-networks/) that can work around CGNAT.

</details>

<details>
<summary><em>Click to expand:</em> ❔ How should I install this updater in ☸️ Kubernetes?</summary>

Due to high maintenance costs, the Kubernetes instructions have been removed. However, you can still generate Kubernetes configurations from the provided Docker Compose template using a conversion tool like [Kompose](https://kompose.io/). **Important:** Only use Kompose version 1.35.0 or later, as these versions support the `user: "UID:GID"` attribute with `:GID`.

Note that a simple [Kubernetes Deployment](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/) will suffice here. Since there’s no inbound network traffic, a [Kubernetes Service](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/) isn’t required.

</details>

<details>
<summary><em>Click to expand:</em> ❔ Help! I got <code>exec /bin/ddns: operation not permitted</code></summary>

Certain Docker installations may have issues with the `no-new-privileges` security option. If you cannot run Docker images with this option (including this updater), removing it might be necessary. This will slightly compromise security, but it’s better than not running the updater at all. If _only_ this updater is affected, please [report this issue on GitHub](https://github.com/favonia/cloudflare-ddns/issues/new).

</details>

<details>
<summary><em>Click to expand:</em> ❔ I am getting <code>error code: 1034</code></summary>

We have received reports of recent issues with the default IP provider, `cloudflare.trace`. Some users are encountering an "error code: 1034," likely due to internal problems with Cloudflare's servers. To work around this, please upgrade the updater to version 1.15.1 or later. Alternatively, you may switch to a different IP provider.

| 🧪 `WAF_LISTS` (since version 1.14.0) | <p>🧪 Comma-separated references of [WAF lists](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/tools/lists/custom-lists/) the updater should manage. A list reference is written in the format `<account-id>/<list-name>` where `account-id` is your account ID and `list-name` is the list name; it should look like `0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef/mylist`. If the referenced WAF list does not exist, the updater will try to create it.</p><p>🔑 The API token needs the **Account - Account Filter Lists - Edit** permission.<br/>💡 See [how to find your account ID](https://developers.cloudflare.com/fundamentals/setup/find-account-and-zone-ids/).</p> |

> 🃏🤖 **Wildcard domains** (`*.example.org`) represent all subdomains that _would not exist otherwise._ Therefore, if you have another subdomain entry `sub.example.org`, the wildcard domain is independent of it, because it only represents the _other_ subdomains which do not have their own entries. Also, you can only have one layer of `*`---`*.*.example.org` would not work.

> 🌐🤖 **Internationalized domain names** are handled using the _nontransitional processing_ (fully compatible with IDNA2008). At this point, all major browsers and whatnot have switched to the same nontransitional processing. See [this useful FAQ on internationalized domain names](https://www.unicode.org/faq/idn.html).

> 🤖 Technical notes on WAF lists:
>
> 1. [Cloudflare does not allow single IPv6 addresses in a WAF list](https://developers.cloudflare.com/waf/tools/lists/custom-lists/#lists-with-ip-addresses-ip-lists), and thus the updater will use the smallest IP range allowed by Cloudflare that contains the detected IPv6 address.
> 2. The updater will delete IP addresses belonging to unmanaged IP families from the specified WAF lists (_e.g.,_ if you disable IPv6 with `IP6_PROVIDER=none`, then existing IPv6 addresses or IPv6 ranges in the lists will be deleted). The idea is that the list should contain only detected IP addresses.

| `IP4_PROVIDER` | This specifies how to detect the current IPv4 address. Available providers include `cloudflare.doh`, `cloudflare.trace`, `local`, `local.iface:<iface>`, `url:<URL>`, and `none`. The special `none` provider disables IPv4 completely. See below for a detailed explanation. | `cloudflare.trace` |
| `IP6_PROVIDER` | This specifies how to detect the current IPv6 address. Available providers include `cloudflare.doh`, `cloudflare.trace`, `local`, `local.iface:<iface>`, `url:<URL>`, and `none`. The special `none` provider disables IPv6 completely. See below for a detailed explanation. | `cloudflare.trace` |

> 👉 The option `IP4_PROVIDER` governs `A`-type DNS records and IPv4 addresses in WAF lists, while the option `IP6_PROVIDER` governs `AAAA`-type DNS records and IPv6 addresses in WAF lists. The two options act independently of each other. You can specify different address providers for IPv4 and IPv6.

<summary><em>Click to expand:</em> 🐣 Parameters of new DNS records and WAF lists (proxy status, TTL, and comments)</summary>

> 👉 The updater will preserve existing parameters (TTL, proxy statuses, DNS record comments, etc.). Only when it creates new DNS records and new WAF lists, the following settings will apply. To change existing parameters, you can go to your [Cloudflare Dashboard](https://dash.cloudflare.com) and change them directly. If you think you have a use case where the updater should actively overwrite existing parameters in addition to IP addresses, please [let me know](https://github.com/favonia/cloudflare-ddns/issues/new). 🐞🧪 **KNOWN ISSUE: comments of stale WAF list items (not WAF lists themselves) will not be kept** because the Cloudflare API does not provide an easy way to update list items. The comments will be lost when the updater deletes stale list items and create new ones.

⚠️ [oznu/cloudflare-ddns](https://github.com/oznu/docker-cloudflare-ddns) relies on the insecure DNS protocol to obtain public IP addresses; a malicious hacker could more easily forge DNS responses and trick it into updating your domain with any IP address. In comparison, we use only verified responses from Cloudflare, which makes the attack much more difficult. See the [design document](docs/DESIGN.markdown) for more information on security.

> 📜 Some historical notes: This updater was originally written as a Go clone of the Python program [timothymiller/cloudflare-ddns](https://github.com/timothymiller/cloudflare-ddns) because the Python program always purged unmanaged DNS records back then and it was not configurable via environment variables. There were feature requests to address these issues but the author [timothymiller](https://github.com/timothymiller/) seemed to ignore them; I thus made my Go clone after unsuccessful communications. Understandably, [timothymiller](https://github.com/timothymiller/) did not seem happy with my cloning and my other critical comments towards other aspects of the Python updater. Eventually, an option `purgeUnknownRecords` was added to the Python program to disable the unwanted purging, and it became configurable via environment variables, but my Go clone already went on its way. I believe my Go clone is now a much better choice, but my opinions are biased and you should check the technical details by yourself. 😉
