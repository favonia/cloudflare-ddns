## üìú Highlights

* Ultra-small Docker images (about 2 to 2.3 MB) on all architectures.
* Ability to update multiple domains across different zones.
* Ability to enable or disable IPv4 and IPv6 individually.
* Support of internationalized domain names.
* Ability to remove stale records or choose to remove records on exit/stop.
* Ability to obtain IP addresses from CloudFlare, ipify, or local network interfaces.
* Support of timezone and Cron expressions.
* Full configurability via environment variables.
* Ability to pass API tokens via a file instead of an environment variable.
* Local caching to reduce CloudFlare API usage.

## üïµÔ∏è Privacy

By default, public IP addresses are obtained through [CloudFlare‚Äôs via DNS-over-HTTPS](https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/dns-over-https). This minimizes the impact on privacy because we are already using the CloudFlare API to update DNS records. You can also configure the tool to use [ipify](https://www.ipify.org) which, unlike the debugging interface, is fully documented.

## üõ°Ô∏è Security

* The root privilege and all capacities are immediately dropped after the program starts.
* The source code depends on these external libraries (not part of the Go project):
  - [cap](https://sites.google.com/site/fullycapable):\
    Manipulation of Linux capabilities.
  - [cloudflare-go](https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflare-go):\
    The official Go binding of CloudFlare API v4. It provides robust handling of pagination, rate limiting, and other tricky details.
  - [cron](https://github.com/robfig/cron):\
    Parsing of Cron expressions.
  - [go-cache](https://github.com/patrickmn/go-cache):\
    Essentially `map[string]interface{}` with expiration times.

## üêã Quick Start with Docker

```bash
docker run \
  --network host \
  -e CF_API_TOKEN=YOUR-CLOUDFLARE-API-TOKEN \
  -e DOMAINS=www.example.org \
  -e PROXIED=true \
  favonia/cloudflare-ddns
```

## üèÉ Quick Start from Source

You need the [Go tool](https://golang.org/doc/install) to run the program from its source.

```bash
export CF_API_TOKEN=YOUR-CLOUDFLARE-API-TOKEN
export DOMAINS=www.example.org
export PROXIED=true
go run ./cmd/ddns.go
```

## üêã Deployment with Docker Compose

### Step 1: Updating the Compose File

Incorporate the following fragment into the compose file (typically `docker-compose.yml` or `docker-compose.yaml`).

```yaml
version: "3"
services:
  cloudflare-ddns:
    image: favonia/cloudflare-ddns:latest
    security_opt:
      - no-new-privileges:true
    network_mode: host
    environment:
      - CF_API_TOKEN
      - DOMAINS
      - PROXIED=true
```

‚ö†Ô∏è The setting `network_mode: host` is for IPv6. If you wish to keep the network separated from the host network, check out the proper way to [enable IPv6 support](https://docs.docker.com/config/daemon/ipv6/).

üí° The setting `no-new-privileges:true` provides additional protection, especially when you run the container as a non-root user. (The program itself will also attempt to drop the root privilege and all capacities.)

üí° The setting `PROXIED=true` instructs CloudFlare to cache webpages and hide your actual IP addresses. If you wish to bypass that, simply remove `PROXIED=true`. (The default value of `PROXIED` is `false`.)

üí° There is no need to use automatic restart (_e.g.,_ `restart: unless-stopped`) because the tool exits only when non-recoverable errors happen or when you manually stop it.

### Step 2: Updating the Environment File

Add these lines to your environment file (typically `.env`):
```bash
CF_API_TOKEN=YOUR-CLOUDFLARE-API-TOKEN
DOMAINS=example.org,www.example.org,example.io
```

- The value of `CF_API_TOKEN` should be an API **token** (_not_ an API key), which can be obtained from the [API Tokens page](https://dash.cloudflare.com/profile/api-tokens). Create a token with the **Zone - DNS - Edit** permission and copy the token into the environment file.

  ‚ö†Ô∏è The legacy API key authentication is intentionally _not_ supported. Please use the more secure API tokens.

- The value of `DOMAINS` should be a list of fully qualified domain names separated by commas. For example, `DOMAINS=example.org,www.example.org,example.io` instructs the tool to manage the domains `example.org`, `www.example.org`, and `example.io`. These domains do not have to be in the same zone---the tool will identify their zones automatically.

The tool should be up and running after these commands:
```bash
docker-compose pull cloudflare-ddns
docker-compose up --detach --build cloudflare-ddns
```

## Further Customization

Here are all the recognized environment variables.

### Authentication

| Name | Valid Values | Meaning | Required? | Default Value |
| ---- | ------------ | ------- | --------- | ------------- |
| `CF_ACCOUNT_ID` | CloudFlare Account IDs | The account ID used to distinguish multiple zone IDs with the same name | No | `""` (unset) |
| `CF_API_TOKEN_FILE` | Paths to files containing CloudFlare API tokens | A file that contains the token to access the CloudFlare API | Exactly one of `CF_API_TOKEN` and `CF_API_TOKEN_FILE` should be set | N/A |
| `CF_API_TOKEN` | CloudFlare API tokens | The token to access the CloudFlare API | Exactly one of `CF_API_TOKEN` and `CF_API_TOKEN_FILE` should be set | N/A |

In most cases, `CF_ACCOUNT_ID` is not needed.

### Record Updating

| Name | Valid Values | Meaning | Required? | Default Value |
| ---- | ------------ | ------- | --------- | ------------- |
| `DOMAINS` | Comma-separated fully qualified domain names | The domains this tool should manage | (See below) | N/A
| `IP4_DOMAINS` | Comma-separated fully qualified domain names | The domains this tool should manage for `A` records | (See below) | N/A
| `IP6_DOMAINS` | Comma-separated fully qualified domain names | The domains this tool should manage for `AAAA` records | (See below) | N/A
| `IP4_POLICY` | `cloudflare`, `ipify`, `local`, and `unmanaged` | (See below) | No | `cloudflare` if `DOMAINS` or `IP4_DOMAINS` is not empty; otherwise, `unmanaged`
| `IP6_POLICY` | `cloudflare`, `ipify`, `local`, and `unmanaged` | (See below) | No | `cloudflare` if `DOMAINS` or `IP6_DOMAINS` is not empty; otherwise, `unmanaged`
| `PROXIED` | `1`, `t`, `T`, `TRUE`, `true`, `True`, `0`, `f`, `F`, `FALSE`, `false`, and `False` | Whether new DNS records should be proxied by CloudFlare | No | `false`
| `TTL` | Time-to-live (TTL) values in seconds | The TTL values used to create new DNS records | No | `1` (This means ‚Äúautomatic‚Äù to CloudFlare)

At least one domain should be specified in `DOMAINS`, `IP4_DOMAINS`, or `IP6_DOMAINS`, for otherwise this program is useless. It is fine to list the same domain in both `IP4_DOMAINS` and `IP6_DOMAINS`, which is equivalent to listing it in `DOMAINS`.

The values of `IP4_POLICY` and `IP6_POLICY` should be one of the following policies:

- `cloudflare`\
  Get the public IP address by querying `whoami.cloudflare.` against [CloudFlare via DNS-over-HTTPS](https://developers.cloudflare.com/1.1.1.1/dns-over-https) and update DNS records accordingly.
- `ipify`\
  Get the public IP address via [ipify‚Äôs public API](https://www.ipify.org/) and update DNS records accordingly.
- `local`\
  Get the address via local network interfaces and update DNS records accordingly. When multiple local network interfaces or in general multiple IP addresses are present, the tool will use the address that would have been used for outbound UDP connections to CloudFlare servers. ‚ö†Ô∏è You need `network_mode: host` for this policy, for otherwise the tool will detect the addresses inside the [bridge network](https://docs.docker.com/network/bridge/) instead of those in the host network.
- `unmanaged`\
  Stop the DNS updating completely. Existing DNS records will not be removed.

The option `IP4_POLICY` is governing IPv4 addresses and `A`-type records, while the option `IP6_POLICY` is governing IPv6 addresses and `AAAA`-type records. The two options act independently of each other.

### Scheduling and Timing

| Name | Valid Values | Meaning | Required? | Default Value |
| ---- | ------------ | ------- | --------- | ------------- |
| `CACHE_EXPIRATION` | Positive time duration with a unit, such as `1h` or `10m`. See [time.ParseDuration](https://golang.org/pkg/time/#ParseDuration) | The expiration of cached CloudFlare API responses | No | `6h0m0s` (6 hours)
| `DELETE_ON_STOP` | `1`, `t`, `T`, `TRUE`, `true`, `True`, `0`, `f`, `F`, `FALSE`, `false`, and `False` | Whether managed DNS records should be deleted on exit | No | `false`
| `DETECTION_TIMEOUT` | Positive time duration with a unit, such as `1h` or `10m`. See [time.ParseDuration](https://golang.org/pkg/time/#ParseDuration) | The timeout of each attempt to detect IP addresses | No | `5s` (5 seconds)
| `REFRESH_CRON` | Cron expressions; [documentation of cron](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/robfig/cron/v3#hdr-CRON_Expression_Format). | The schedule to re-check IP addresses and update DNS records (if necessary) | No | `@every 5m` (every 5 minutes)
| `REFRESH_ON_START` | `1`, `t`, `T`, `TRUE`, `true`, `True`, `0`, `f`, `F`, `FALSE`, `false`, and `False` | Whether to check IP addresses on start regardless of `REFRESH_CRON` | No | `true`
| `TZ` | Recognized timezones, such as `UTC` | The timezone used for logging and parsing `REFRESH_CRON` | No | `UTC`

Note that the update schedule does not take the time to update records into consideration. For example, if the schedule is ‚Äúfor every 5 minutes‚Äù, and if the updating itself takes 2 minutes, then the interval between adjacent updates is 3 minutes, not 5 minutes.

### Security

| Name | Valid Values | Meaning | Required? | Default Value |
| ---- | ------------ | ------- | --------- | ------------- |
| `PGID` | Non-zero POSIX group ID | The effective group ID the tool should assume | No | Effective group ID; if it is zero, then the real group ID; if it is still zero, then `1000`
| `PUID` | Non-zero POSIX user ID | The effective user ID the tool should assume | No | Effective user ID; if it is zero, then the real user ID; if it is still zero, then `1000`

The tool will also try to drop supplementary groups.

### Others

| Name | Valid Values | Meaning | Required? | Default Value |
| ---- | ------------ | ------- | --------- | ------------- |
| `QUIET` | `1`, `t`, `T`, `TRUE`, `true`, `True`, `0`, `f`, `F`, `FALSE`, `false`, and `False` | Whether the tool should reduce the logging | No | `false`

### Updating the Containers

If you are using Docker Compose, run `docker-compose up --detach` to update the containers with new settings.
