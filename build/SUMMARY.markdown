## Supported Tags

- `latest`: the latest released version
- `edge`: the latest development version
- `X`: the latest released version where the major version is `X` (e.g. `1`)
- `X.Y.Z` (where `X.Y.Z.` is a released version): a specific released version

ðŸš¨ If you are using [LXC (Linux Containers)](https://linuxcontainers.org/), it is known that the standard build may hang or halt (see [issue #707](https://github.com/favonia/cloudflare-ddns/issues/707)). If you encounter this problem, as a workaround, please use the following `-nocapdrop` variants to disable the explicit dropping of capabilities:

> - `latest-nocapdrop`: the latest released version
> - `edge-nocapdrop`: the latest development version
> - `X-nocapdrop`: the latest released version where the major version is `X` (e.g. `1`)
> - `X.Y.Z-nocapdrop` (where `X.Y.Z.` is a released version): a specific released version
