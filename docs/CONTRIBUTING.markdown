## ‚å®Ô∏è Coding Style

We rely on linters to enforce coding styles. Run `golangci-lint run` at the root of the repository to check whether you have followed the current style.

- Your pull request must pass all CI (continuous integration) checks, possibly except the coverage check.
- You should add tests for new features or bug fixes (to detect regression).
- You should strive to maximize the coverage as much as possible and practical.

## üìë Commit Messages and Pull Request Titles

- We loosely follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/), and will update pull request titles for you.
- Do not worry too much about the commit messages as long as it is clear what individual commits are for.
