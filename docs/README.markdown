# Documentation

`docs/designs/` contains design documents for future developers, including AI agents.

Use it for durable design decisions, constraints, and intended extension points.

The `docs/designs/` collection should be self-contained. Documents there may refer to each other, but they should not depend on private planning documents outside this collection.

Start with [`docs/designs/README.markdown`](designs/README.markdown) for an overview of the collection.
