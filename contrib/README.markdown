## üì¶ Sample Systemd unit file

_(contributed by [Thomas @sumgryph](https://github.com/symgryph))_

‚ö†Ô∏è Docker, by default, enforces better isolation than Systemd. Moreover, the sample Systemd service unit file intentionally turns off several protections for efficiency and convenience. Using the official Docker images (along with its [restart policy](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/run/#restart-policies---restart)) is recommended for better security. You are at your own risks to use the following Systemd service unit file.

- See [cloudflare-ddns.service](./cloudflare-ddns.service) for a sample Systemd service unit file.
- See [cloudflare-ddns.service.env](./cloudflare-ddns.service.env) for a sample Systemd environment file.
